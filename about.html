         <h2>About Alluthus</h2>
         <p>Indie artist Alluthus had always wanted to create music since he was a young child. Having very little knowledge on playing instruments did not stop him from producing tracks on GarageBand.</p>
         <p>Alluthus is the alias used by Joseph "Joey" Madril III, a Las Vegas, Nevada native. A self-taught photographer, web designer and graphic designer, Alluthus' music is based on tons of different genres, from country to hard rock and electronic.</p>
         <p>"Growing up, I listened to a lot of different musicial genres such as country and punk pop. A lot of the artists I listened to as a child inspired what I now make."</p>
         <p>In 2017, Alluthus shared his first track, Urban Groove, on SoundCloud using the alias "Verso". Plans for an independent album fell through though by 2018.</p>
         <p>"I wanted to improve on my skills in graphic design and also at the time, I wanted to learn web development."</p>
         <p>In 2018, Alluthus joined the <a href="https://team.stibarc.com">STiBaRC Team</a>, a small group of teenagers who manage <a href="https://stibarc.com">STiBaRC</a>. In late 2019, indie record label <a href="https://records.stibarc.com">STiBaRC Records</a> was founded by Alluthus, Joshua Herron and Ben Border. Alluthus' first single in major stores was released to stores in January 2020 but was later taken down a few days after.</p>
        <p>"I used 'Verso' as the artist name for my first single on the stores, and that was a mistake. I didn't know there were so many artists with the same name! My music got mixed in with other artists on so many different services. After that, I decided to use 'Alluthus' for my future releases."</p>
        <p>In March 2020, Alluthus' first digital EP, Golden Days, appeared in stores. In April 2020, his second single, Persona, was released to stores.</p>
        <p>"Although I'm releasing music to stores using the name 'Alluthus', I still use 'Verso' for my designs. I don't regret using 'Alluthus' for my releases though because it can be found easily online unlike 'Verso'."</p>
