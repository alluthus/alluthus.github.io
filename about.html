        <p>Joseph "Joey" Madril III is a hobbyist web designer, graphic designer and photographer.</p>
        <p>Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, Madril spent majority of his childhood in the Las Vegas valley.
            As a child, Madril was quite stubborn in trying new things (which still is somewhat true to this day) and
            had a short-lived interest in highway engineering.</p>
        <p>After seeing a friend's game made with a website called Scratch in 2015, Madril began to develop an interest
            in coding. In late 2016, he began to use the alias "Verso" online and taught himself the basics of graphic
            design. He attempted to create a game on Scratch called "Life" from 2016-2018, eventually an incomplete
            version being shared.</p>
        <p>In late 2017, Madril independently released his first instrumental single, "Urban Groove", using the alias
            Verso. The track was planned to be part of an album, but the project was scrapped in 2018. In April 2018, he
            joined the <a href="https://team.stibarc.com/">STiBaRC Team</a>, a group of teenagers who manage a social
            media service and other services by <a href="https://joshiepoo.gq/">Joshua Herron.</a> Later that year, he
            made his first website, "BaSTPC" (Later
            renamed "Aurora"), a third party client of <a href="https://stibarc.com/">STiBaRC</a>.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Madril shared a set of poems he wrote on his website titled "Retribution" and co-founded STiBaRC
            Records with Herron and <a href="https://bunnbunts.net">Ben Border</a>. In January 2020, he released his
            first digital single to
            stores. After a catalog mixup, he began to use the alias "Alluthus" for his releases. His second
            single was released in March 2020, along with his debut EP "Golden Days". His third single appeared in April
            2020 and his debut album "Memory Lane" was released in May 2020. A deluxe version of the album was released
            in July 2020.</p>
        <p>Madril graduated from high school in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and will be attending college in fall.
